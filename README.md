# Subsquid Community Repository

Welcome to the Repository dedicated to our Community.
## Overview

The Subsquid Community Repository is primarily going to be the right place for submitting contributions made by the Subsquid community members.

This generally includes any kind of deliverable that is part of a Quest, or any other spontaneous kind of submission. In order for contributions to be accepted, it is expected that a Pull Request to this repository is created.

The ultimate goal is for this repository to be managed by the community itself, through its designed administrative members. For now, Subsquid will handle submissions approval.

## Guideline for submissions

- When submitting a deliverable for a Quest, please create a dedicated folder, named after the Quest title:

  - "Helm charts for Squid Archives" => `squid archives helm charts`

- Such folder should contain all the work done. How to best organize the subfolders structure is left to the contributor.

- A Pull Request to the repository's `main` branch should be made.

## Bugs and improvements

Software is known to be an ever-evolving creature, adapting, responding to change and with many, many bugs needing to be fixed, especially in its early iterations.

It is very unlikely that Subsquid would be any different and we welcome the input of our community in these matters.

### Reporting issues

Although this is the Repository dedicated to our Community, if you find any bugs in our software, please report them by creating an `Issue` in the [main Squid repository](https://github.com/subsquid/squid).

We will be posting "Bug Bounties" and reward those who report issues, depending on various factors, such as the quality of information provided, the severity of the problem and indication on how to reproduce it.

## Quests

Subsquid proposes Quests to the community, consisting in tasks that are either directly useful or impactful to the project, or sometimes simply to engage community members with fun activities.

As a consequence, tasks will be varied in terms of subject and required skillsets and interests. For starters, we have created two "Squads": Abyss and Sonar.
Community members with technical skills would be more interested into Abyss Squad quests, whereas Sonar Squad quests are aimed at those with a more prominent creative skillset.

The level of difficulty will vary as well: most will be rather easy to tackle, but from time to time, some may require additional effort and research. We hope you will enjoy the challenge!
